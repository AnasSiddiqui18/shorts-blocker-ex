# YouTube Shorts Nuker 🚀 (Currently Building)

_(Because Shorts are digital crack 🚫)_

Tired of YouTube shoving Shorts down your throat? This extension permanently nukes Shorts from your feed, search, and even direct links—giving you back control of your attention span.

## 🔥 Features

### 1. Total Shorts Annihilation

- 🧹 Cleanses Shorts from your homepage, subscriptions, and recommendations.
- 🛑 Blocks navigation to any /shorts URL (redirects to YouTube home)

### 2. Real-Time DOM Patrol

- Uses MutationObserver API 👁️ to detect and destroy Shorts the moment YouTube injects them.
- Scans deep in the DOM (no sneaky Shorts can hide)

## 💻 Tech Stack

- Built with Plasmo _(because extensions should be easy)_
- MutationObserver API for real-time DOM scanning
- Chrome Manifest V3 for maximum compatibility

## 📌 Why This Exists

_YouTube keeps forcing Shorts like it's 2020 TikTok. Not on my watch._

## 🎯 Perfect For

- Productivity nerds 🧠
- People who miss old YouTube 🕰️
- Anyone who thinks 15-second videos are a crime ⏳
